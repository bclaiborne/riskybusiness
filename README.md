Requires the Gosu 2D game development library. http://www.libgosu.org/

From the command prompt, run:

ruby start_game.rb

Known Issues:
Currently you are able to attack diagonally. 
The game does not check borders before initiating an attack. 

If the game expands beyond a 2x2 map, territory borders will need to be implemented.

Transferring units to a conquered territory is currently one way only. 
If too many units are moved, you cannot 'undo' it.
